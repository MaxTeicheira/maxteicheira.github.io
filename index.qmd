## Bio


I am an electrical engineering student at University of California, Santa Cruz working at the Radiological Insturments Laboratory(RIL). My research for RIL focuses on positon emission tomography(PET) imaging using edge-on cross-strip CZT. 

I will complete my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering in 2025, then start my PhD immediately to continue my research.

I am also a part-time employee at Slugworks, a makerspace located in Baskin Engineering at UCSC.

You can find a [list of my projects here](projects). I write on random topics related to tools and making -- look through my [notebook](blog) here.

## Key research interests

* **Depth of Interaction in edge-on CZT**: Charge carrier movement through CZT
* **Building Modular CZT devices**: For use in larger applications such as whole body scanners
* **Low cost open source solutions for experiments**: CNC automation of experiments, Custom 3d printed tools, Custom collimator designs

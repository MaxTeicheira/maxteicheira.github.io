## Positron Emission Tomography with CZT Detectors

I work at the [Radiological Instruments Laboratory (RIL)](https://rfrg.soe.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz, where my research focuses on improving PET imaging using cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors.

### What is PET imaging?

Positron emission tomography is a medical imaging technique that detects pairs of gamma rays emitted from a radioactive tracer injected into the body. By detecting these gamma ray pairs, we can reconstruct 3D images showing metabolic processes -- this is critical for cancer diagnosis, cardiac imaging, and neurological research.

### Why CZT?

Most PET scanners use scintillator crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes. CZT is a semiconductor detector that converts gamma rays directly into electrical signals, offering:

- **Better energy resolution** -- sharper distinction between true events and scattered radiation
- **Room-temperature operation** -- no cryogenic cooling required
- **Compact form factor** -- enables novel detector geometries

### My work: Edge-on cross-strip CZT

Traditional CZT detectors orient the crystal face-on to incoming radiation. Our lab uses an **edge-on** geometry, where gamma rays enter through the thin edge of the crystal. This gives us:

- A longer interaction path through the detector material
- The ability to measure **depth of interaction (DOI)** from the charge carrier drift pattern
- Better spatial resolution for the same crystal volume

I work on characterizing charge carrier transport through these edge-on crystals and developing modular detector units that can be tiled into larger imaging arrays.

<!-- TODO: Max - add a diagram of edge-on vs face-on geometry here if you have one -->

## Open-source instrumentation

One of my goals is to make experimental instrumentation more accessible. Projects in this area include:

- **CNC-automated detector scanning** -- Using open-source motion control to automate collimated beam experiments
- **Custom 3D-printed collimators** -- Low-cost alternatives to machined lead or tungsten collimators
- **Custom test fixtures** -- Machined and printed fixtures for repeatable detector positioning

See my [projects page](projects) for details on the hardware I've built to support this work.

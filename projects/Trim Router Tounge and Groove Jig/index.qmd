## Background

![](3d_model.png)

I wanted to experiment with making custom router jigs after seeing a some amazing Japanese woodworking youtube shorts.

I can't find the video, but it looks nearly identical to the 3d model above except mine is 3d printed instead of make of hardwood. Mine does use a hardwood runner to guide the joint as I find there is often too much flex and variation in 3d prints.

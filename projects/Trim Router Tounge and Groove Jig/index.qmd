## The Problem

Tongue and groove joints are one of the most common joints in woodworking -- used for panels, flooring, and box construction. Dedicated tongue and groove router bit sets exist, but they're expensive and limited to specific stock thicknesses. A simple jig with a standard straight bit is more versatile.

## Design

<!-- TODO: Max - describe the jig:
- How does it reference against the workpiece?
- What range of stock thicknesses does it handle?
- Is it adjustable or fixed?
- What material is it made from? (plywood, MDF, 3D printed?)
- What bit does it use?
-->

## Result

<!-- TODO: Max - show some example joints if you have photos. How tight are the fits? -->

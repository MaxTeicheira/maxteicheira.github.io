## The Problem

<!-- TODO: Max - why did you build a router table instead of buying one? What specific requirements did you have that commercial options didn't meet? (size, mounting, dust collection, budget?) -->

## Design and Build

<!-- TODO: Max - describe the key design decisions:
- What material is the table surface? (MDF, phenolic, aluminum plate?)
- How is the fence designed? Adjustable? Split?
- What router is mounted underneath?
- How does the dust collection work? (the vacuum port photo is interesting - explain it)
- Any joinery details? (the dovetail closeup suggests hand-cut or machined dovetails)
- What are the overall dimensions?
-->

## Result

<!-- TODO: Max - how does it perform? What have you used it for? What would V1 change? The "V0" name implies you already have ideas for improvement. -->

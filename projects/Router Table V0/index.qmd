## The Problem

Commercial router tables are either cheap and flimsy or expensive and locked into one configuration. I wanted something modular -- a table I could reconfigure, add dust collection to, and adapt as my needs change -- without spending more than the router itself costs.

Building it myself also meant I could size it for my shop and integrate it with my existing workflow.

## Design and Build

The design prioritizes modularity -- the fence, insert plate, and dust collection are all removable or reconfigurable. The dovetail joinery provides rigidity while keeping the table easy to disassemble for modifications.

The dust collection port routes directly from under the table surface, capturing chips at the source rather than relying on a separate hood over the workpiece.

<!-- TODO: Max - add any details you'd like:
- What's the table surface material?
- What router is mounted underneath?
- Overall dimensions?
- Anything you'd change for V1?
-->

## Result

A functional router table that cost a fraction of a commercial equivalent while being fully customizable. The "V0" label reflects the fact that it's a platform I keep improving -- the modularity means upgrades are bolt-on rather than starting over.

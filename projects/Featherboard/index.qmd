## The Problem

Featherboards hold stock firmly against the fence and table during routing and sawing operations. They prevent kickback and ensure consistent, safe cuts. Commercial featherboards work fine, but printing one in PLA lets you size it exactly for your setup and replace it when the fingers wear out.

## Design

The featherboard is printed in PLA, which provides just enough flex in the fingers to apply consistent pressure against the workpiece while guiding it along the fence. The angled fingers deflect as stock feeds through, then spring back -- allowing forward movement while resisting kickback.

PLA works well here because it's stiff enough to apply real pressure but has enough give to avoid marring the workpiece. When the fingers eventually fatigue and lose their spring, printing a replacement takes less than an hour.

<!-- TODO: Max - add any details:
- How does it clamp to the table? (T-track bolt, C-clamp, etc.)
- What finger angle and spacing did you use?
- Print orientation -- fingers printed flat or on edge?
-->

## Result

A simple, effective shop tool that costs pennies to make and minutes to replace. It sees regular use at the router table and table saw.

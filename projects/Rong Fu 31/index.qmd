## The Problem

I needed a milling machine rigid enough to do real work. My two previous mills were under 150 lbs each, and I was constantly fighting deflection and chatter. Lightweight benchtop mills are fine for drilling and light engraving, but the moment you try to take a serious cut in aluminum or steel, the lack of mass shows.

## The Machine

I acquired this Rong Fu 31 from someone who could no longer store it. It had never been used -- the original waxy shipping oil was still on every surface, and when I disassembled it for transport, the paint cracked at every joint, confirming I was the first person to do any maintenance on it.

The RF31 is a round-column mill/drill, weighing roughly 600 lbs. "Mill/drill" indicates its dual role: primarily a drill press, secondarily a lightweight milling machine. At 4x the mass of my previous machines, the improvement in rigidity was dramatic. Weight is king when it comes to precision -- heavier machines absorb vibration and resist cutting forces far better.

## Upgrades

### Digital Readout (DRO)

**The problem:** Manual milling without a DRO means counting handwheel graduations and keeping a running tally on paper. It's slow, error-prone, and makes repeatable setups tedious.

**The solution:** I sourced a 3-axis DRO kit from AliExpress, specifying scale lengths to match the RF31's travel distances from the manual. Most DRO kits come pre-packaged for specific machines with bolt-on brackets, but since there's no RF31-specific kit available, I ordered bare scales and designed the mounting myself.

<!-- TODO: Max - describe the mounting brackets/approach you used. Did you machine custom brackets? 3D print? What material? -->

**What I'd do differently:** The glass scales are accurate but fragile -- I'd add chip guards from the start next time rather than retrofitting them after getting swarf on a scale.

## Result

The DRO transformed the usability of this machine. Setups that used to take 15 minutes of dial-indicating now take seconds. Combined with the rigidity of the 600 lb frame, I can now hold tolerances that were impossible on my lighter machines.

<!-- TODO: Max - if you have any measurements (repeatability, backlash numbers, tolerance examples), add them here. Even rough numbers like "I can reliably hold ±0.002 in aluminum" would add credibility. -->

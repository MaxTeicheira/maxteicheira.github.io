## The Problem

Toolpost grinders are used to grind hardened steel and achieve surface finishes that are impossible with a lathe tool alone. Commercial toolpost grinders are expensive, and many are oversized for small hobby lathes.

A trim router spins at 25,000+ RPM -- not far from what a small grinding spindle needs. The question was whether I could adapt one into a usable toolpost grinder.

## Design

<!-- TODO: Max - describe the design:
- What trim router did you use?
- How does it mount to the toolpost? (custom adapter plate? QC toolpost holder?)
- What grinding wheels/points does it accept?
- What material is the adapter? (machined aluminum? 3D printed?)
- Any vibration or runout concerns at those RPMs?
-->

## Result

<!-- TODO: Max - what have you ground with it? How does the surface finish compare to turning? Any measurements (surface roughness, concentricity)? What are its limitations? -->

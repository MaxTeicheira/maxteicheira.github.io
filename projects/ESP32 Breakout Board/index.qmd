## The Problem

The ESP32 is a versatile microcontroller for lab automation and IoT projects, but breadboarding with the raw module is tedious -- the pin spacing doesn't fit standard breadboards cleanly, and wiring up the same support circuitry (voltage regulation, USB-serial, reset/boot buttons) every time wastes hours.

I wanted a reusable breakout board that exposes all the pins I regularly use in a clean, labeled layout.

<!-- TODO: Max - fill in the details below based on your actual design -->

<!-- Key design decisions:
- What ESP32 module variant did you use? (ESP32-WROOM, WROVER, etc.)
- What interfaces did you break out? (I2C, SPI, UART, ADC, DAC?)
- What support circuitry did you include? (voltage regulator, USB-serial chip, buttons, LEDs?)
- What PCB design tool did you use? (KiCad, Eagle, EasyEDA?)
- Board specs: layer count, dimensions, trace width/spacing?
- Where did you fabricate it? (JLCPCB, OSH Park, etc.)

<!-- TODO: Max - what changed between V0 and V0.1? What problems did V0 have that you fixed? Revision history shows engineering maturity. -->

## Result

<!-- TODO: Max - how does this board get used? Lab work? Personal projects? What would V0.2 change? -->

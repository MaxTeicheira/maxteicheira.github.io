## The Problem

The ESP8266-12F is a cheap, capable WiFi module useful for IoT projects and lab automation, but prototyping with the bare module is a pain. The castellated pads don't fit a breadboard, and every new project means rewiring the same boot circuitry, voltage regulation, and serial interface from scratch.

I wanted a breakout board that makes the ESP8266-12F as easy to work with as dropping a dev board into a breadboard -- but without paying for features I don't need.

## Design

![V0.1 schematic](v0.1_schem.png)

The board breaks out the ESP8266-12F's GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, and ADC pins to breadboard-friendly headers with clear labels. Support circuitry handles 3.3V regulation, boot mode selection, and USB-serial for programming.

Designed in **KiCad** and fabricated by **PCBWay**.

## Previous revision

![V0 board](v0.png)

The V0 board was the first attempt. V0.1 addressed issues found during initial testing.

<!-- TODO: Max - what specifically changed between V0 and V0.1? Bad footprint? Routing issue? Missing pull-up? This kind of revision history shows real engineering process. -->

## Result

The breakout board has become a go-to starting point for quick WiFi-enabled projects, cutting setup time from an hour of wiring to just plugging in a module.

<!-- TODO: Max - what projects have you used this in? Lab work? Home automation? -->

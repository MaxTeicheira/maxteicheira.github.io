## The Problem

Packing salt pills into capsules by hand is slow and inconsistent. Each capsule gets a slightly different fill, and the process is tedious enough that doing a large batch becomes impractical. I needed a simple tool to make capsule packing repeatable and fast.

## Design

The packer is printed in PLA and designed to hold multiple capsules in alignment while a press mechanism ensures consistent fill. The geometry is sized to match standard capsule dimensions.

This is the third iteration of the design. The first version had tolerance issues -- the capsules fit too loosely to stay aligned. The second revision tightened the pockets but made insertion difficult. V3 found the right balance between a snug fit and easy loading.

<!-- TODO: Max - add any details:
- What capsule size does it work with?
- How many capsules per batch?
- What printer did you use?
- Any interesting print settings (layer height, infill) that mattered for the tight tolerances?
-->

## Result

Three iterations to get it right, but the final version packs capsules consistently and quickly. A good example of how 3D printing lets you iterate through designs cheaply -- each revision was a few hours of print time and a few cents of PLA.

## The Problem

<!-- TODO: Max - what problem does this solve? What were you packing capsules for? (supplements, experimental samples, etc.) What was the manual process like before this tool? -->

## Design

<!-- TODO: Max - describe the design:
- What CAD tool did you use?
- What printer and material? (PLA, PETG, resin?)
- Any interesting design features? (snap fits, alignment features, tolerances for capsule sizing?)
- How many iterations did it take?
-->

## Result

<!-- TODO: Max - how well does it work? How many capsules per batch? Consistency improvements vs. doing it by hand? -->

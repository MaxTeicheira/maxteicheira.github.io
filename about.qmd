Hello, I like to build stuff. I'm always looking to find ways to learn new skills and find novel ways to apply them. 

I believe that there is no subsitute for experience and that mistakes accelerate learning by forcing us to be critical of our process. Which allows for improvement, small incremental improvement is the goal.

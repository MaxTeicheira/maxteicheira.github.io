title: "About Me"
---

I'm an electrical engineering student and researcher at UC Santa Cruz, where I work at the Radiological Instruments Laboratory on next-generation PET imaging detectors. I'm also a part-time employee at Slugworks, a makerspace in Baskin Engineering.

## How I work

I believe the best engineers operate at every level of abstraction. In the same week I might be simulating charge transport in a CZT crystal, designing a PCB to read out detector signals, and machining an aluminum fixture to hold the whole assembly. Being able to move between theory, electronics, and fabrication means I can go from idea to working prototype without waiting on anyone else.

## My shop

I maintain a small home shop with a Rong Fu 31 milling machine, a lathe, a router table, and a collection of 3D printers. Most of my [projects](projects) start here -- I prototype fixtures, tooling, and enclosures before bringing them into the lab.

## Philosophy

There is no substitute for experience. Mistakes accelerate learning by forcing you to be critical of your process. Small, incremental improvement is the goal.

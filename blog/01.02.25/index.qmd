## Machining as a way of thinking

Like any subtractive process, machining starts with a larger piece of material and removes what you don't want. But the real shift isn't in the process -- it's in how you learn to *think*.

When you design a part knowing you'll machine it yourself, every feature gets evaluated differently:

- **Can I reach this surface with the tools I have?** Internal corners need a radius at least as large as your endmill. A sharp inside corner on a drawing means a different setup or a different process.
- **How will I hold this part?** Fixturing is half the battle. A beautiful design that can't be clamped is a design that can't be made.
- **What order do I cut features in?** Removing material changes the part's rigidity. Cut a thin wall too early and it will flex under the next operation.

This kind of thinking bleeds into everything else. When I design a PCB enclosure, I'm already thinking about how the mill will approach each pocket. When I lay out a 3D print, I'm thinking about support structures the same way I think about fixturing.

The machine teaches you to respect material, to plan operations in sequence, and to think three moves ahead. It's the closest thing engineering has to chess.

<!-- TODO: Max - if you want to expand this, consider adding:
- A specific example from your shop (a part where operation order mattered)
- Photos of a setup that illustrates fixturing challenges
- Your thoughts on when to machine vs. print vs. buy

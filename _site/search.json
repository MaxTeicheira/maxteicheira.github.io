When I design a PCB enclosure, I’m already thinking about how the mill will approach each pocket.

The angled fingers deflect as stock feeds through, then spring back – allowing forward movement while resisting kickback.\nPLA works well here because it’s stiff enough to apply real pressure but has enough give to avoid marring the workpiece.

It had never been used – the original waxy shipping oil was still on every surface, and when I disassembled it for transport, the paint cracked at every joint, confirming I was the first person to do any maintenance on it.\nThe RF31 is a round-column mill/drill, weighing roughly 600 lbs. “Mill/drill” indicates its dual role: primarily a drill press, secondarily a lightweight milling machine. At 4x the mass of my previous machines, the improvement in rigidity was dramatic. Weight is king when it comes to precision – heavier machines absorb vibration and resist cutting forces far better."

Most DRO kits come pre-packaged for specific machines with bolt-on brackets, but since there’s no RF31-specific kit available, I ordered bare scales and designed the mounting myself.\n\nWhat I’d do differently: The glass scales are accurate but fragile – I’d add chip guards from the start next time rather than retrofitting them after getting swarf on a scale.\n\nX-Axis Scale\n\n\n\nX-axis DRO scale installation\n\n\n\n\nY-Axis Scale\n\n\n\nY-axis DRO scale installation"

    "text": "Toolpost grinders are used on lathes to grind hardened materials and achieve surface finishes that cutting tools can’t match. Commercial toolpost grinders are expensive, and many are oversized for small hobby lathes.\nI had an older Makita trim router with a plastic housing – too worn for precision routing, but still spinning at 25,000+ RPM. That’s close to what a small grinding spindle needs. The question was whether I could adapt it into a usable toolpost grinder."

The trim router’s high RPM makes short work of them with the right grinding point."

    "text": "Result\nA functional toolpost grinder built from a retired trim router. It won’t replace a proper cylindrical grinder, but for occasional grinding of hard materials on the lathe, it’s been a worthwhile addition to the shop. The total cost was essentially just the adapter material and a set of grinding points."

    "text": "How I work\nI believe the best engineers operate at every level of abstraction. In the same week I might be simulating charge transport in a CZT crystal, designing a PCB to read out detector signals, and machining an aluminum fixture to hold the whole assembly. Being able to move between theory, electronics, and fabrication means I can go from idea to working prototype without waiting on anyone else."

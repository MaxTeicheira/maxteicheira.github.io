    "text": "Purpose\nI wanted to have a router table to have more control over my woodworking router and be able to quickly use it with minimal setup. Router tables are very simple in construction, so there are many different options when designing.\n\nRestrictions\nAt the time, I didn’t have many woodworking tools but I had a CNC and a 3d printer.\n\nMinimal cost\nCNC cut wood only\n3d printed hardware\n\n\n\nDesign goals\n\nAdjustable fence\nDust extraction\nEasy access to router"

    "title": "Router Table - V0",
    "section": "Design Choices",
    "text": "Design Choices\n\nAdjustable Fence\n The fence has replaceable front faces that slide open so I can tune the air flow for the dust extraction. These faces are adjusted by releasing the 3d printed knob(orange) on the back of the fence.\n\nTo whole fence can move forwards by adusting another 3d printed knob(blue) that engages a wedge in the 3d printed dovetail slot.\n The dovetail wedge has a bolt pressed into it so the knob can pull the wedge up, locking the wedge into the dovetail to lock the fence. The bolt is not shown here but extends up through the fence to the blue knob.\n\n\nDust extraction\n The vaccum adapter was kept simple, just a taper to match my vaccum hose. The airflow is is tuned by adjusting the width of the gap in the fence. The vaccum adapter also adds to the rigidity of the fence.\n\n\nReplacement router plate mount\n The plate that came with my router didn’t not have apropriate mounting holes and had too large of an opening. I redesigned it to have a wider area that would easily index into the table and could be firmly mounted. Additional airflow holes were added to allow debris to not interfere with the cuts. This part was 3d printed out of ABS, with an option for replaceable zero clearance insert.\n\n\nCNC box joint plywood\nThe box construction is entirely CNC cut and tightly fits together. The joints are fastened together only with screws temporarily(for 1 year)."

    "section": "Problems",
    "text": "Problems\n\nLack of rigidity\nLikely due to the non-glued joints and difficulties with tightening dovetail.\n\n\nLack of flatness\nThe CNC cut joints all protruded past the top surface requiring them to be sanded down, however the veneer is very thin and I often sanded through resulting in even more inconsistencies.\n\n\nToo tall\nThe router table needed to be tall enough to contain the full travel of the router but is also table mounted so is too tall for easy use.\n\n\nDifficult to adjust\nThe fence is difficult to do micro-adjustments, likely due to the stick-slip nature of the ABS dovetail surfaces.\n\n\nNon-square fence\nThe fence would go out of alignment whenever it was moved, likely due to the lack of rigidity in the fence.\n\n\nNo miter slot\nWithout a miter slot I was unable to securely move parts across the router bit, which led to many damaged parts where the bit grabbed the part."

So mounting features for the router table so it can be aligned perfectly flush with adjoining tables will be crucial so to not jam movement across the table surface.\nI think Mattias’ tilting router lift will dictace the whole mount and bottom assembly.\nThe fence needs to be much more rigid, ideally a monolithic part with many methods for micro-adjustments.\nA miter slot would allow for many ways to run the move the parts across the bit, giving me access to many different jig options."
